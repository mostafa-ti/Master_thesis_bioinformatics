This work aimed to understand the aging signature on the neurogenesis process in the brain. For this purpose, three regions of mice brain, the Dentate Gyrus (DG), Subventricular zone (SVZ), and Olfactory Bulb (OB), in three age sample groups young (3 months), adults (14 months), and aged (24 months) were compared. This project provided an RNA velocity map of neurogenic niches of mice, together with substantial new knowledge about the biology of newly born neuroblasts and how they are affected by aging. Overall, our data advanced our understanding of the aging signature on the neurogenesis process in the brain.
